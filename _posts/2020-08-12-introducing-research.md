title: Theory of Tumor Heterogeneity
---

We innovate computational algorithms to quantify and model tumor heterogeneity (TH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and leverage the patterns of TH to prioritize genomic drivers.

**_Timing of SCNAs_**: A genomic region, resting on a copy number (CN) state, acquires mutations at a rate proportional to its CN. Leveraging this bias, we can chart the timing of somatic copy number aberrations during somatic evolution. In this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.495959) we uncovered late clonal CN gains appearing right before the onset of tumor expansion and modeled their effect in promoting tumor growth.

**_Tumor Clonal Dynamics_**: we perform `data driven modeling` of single-cell based spatial tumor growth, to reveal the principles that govern the relation between genomic heterogeneity, clonal dynamics, and sequencing detectability of somatic variants.

**_Computational Genomics in Tumor Heterogeneity_**: We push the limits in computational methods to achieve a high-fidelity quantification of (epi)genomic heterogeneity from tumor sequencing data (including CNA, SV, SNV, Gene Expression etc). Biases are inescapable but can be informative when we understand them better.

**_Visualizing Genomic Heterogeneity_**: Data visualizaion plays critical role in computational genomics. We develop visualization tools for tumor sequencing data to reveal the patterns of tumor heterogeneity, facilitate feature extraction, identify potential biases and inspire hypotheses regarding the dynamics of human cancers.
